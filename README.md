## How It Works

1. When enabled, the extension injects a content script into the active tab.
2. The script scans all links on the page and removes predefined tracking parameters from their URLs.
3. It also monitors for dynamically added links and cleans them automatically.
4. When disabled, the tab reloads to revert URLs to their original form.
